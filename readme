    /**
      COMMENT:
        We are using node to tranlate the msg from each user. Look into the server.js file

        So every time that user enters a msg we grab the msg and use /translate in our server to call 
        http://api.phteven.io/intakepoint/ and then parse the data and send it back to to the frontend
        to post the translated msg. (lines 25 and function starting in line 75)

        The rest of the project use node as a server for sockets IO.
